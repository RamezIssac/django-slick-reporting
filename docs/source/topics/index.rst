ReportView is a ``django.views.generic.FromView`` subclass that exposes the **Report Generator API** allowing you to create a report seamlessly in a view.

* Exposes the report generation options in the view class.
* Auto generate the filter form based on the report model, or uses your custom form to generate and filter the report.
* Return an html page prepared to display the results in a table and charts.
* Export to CSV, which is extendable to apply other exporting methods. (like yaml or other)
* Print the report in a dedicated page design.
